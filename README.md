# OpenCV Learning Repository

Welcome to my OpenCV learning repository! This repository contains code and resources related to my learning journey with OpenCV.

## About OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. 
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products.
